    title: Headings and Paragraphs
    content: |
      In this lesson we're going to start working with the different types of blocks use for formatting text an HTML.

      There are many tag types and HTML, but in this lesson we will be focusing on the heading tags and the paragraph tag.


- slide:
    content: |
      Each of these tags have a different purpose in HTML.

      The heading tags are used to start new sections of content on your page. By default, they're displayed in a large and bold font.

      [snippet heading_example]


- slide:
    content: |
      Paragraphs, on the other hand, are used to display sections of text. Most of the time, paragraphs have additional margin space around them.

      Generally speaking, you'll have many more paragraphs then you will have headings on a page.


- slide:
    content: |
      We'll learn more about it in later lessons, but headings actually have a specific purpose. Headings are used by screen readers help blind people read your webpage, as well as help search engines understand the structure of your page.

      Headings should not be used to simply change the size or boldness of a font. In later lessons, we will be learning the correct way to change the style of a webpage.


- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Let's get started adding some headings to our page.

      Open the file named `index.html` in the File Browser on the left side of the screen.


- slide:
    content: |
      At this point you're already familiar with writing [define html_element s]. Let's start by adding a `h1` [define html_element element] to this page.


- slide:
    content: |
      Okay, let's do that again for the remaining heading [define html_element elements].

      There are six in total heading elements in [define html]. Try and added the remaining five heading elements.

- slide:
    title: Using Paragraphs
    mode: overlay
    content: |
      Paragraphs are another way to add text to your webpage, but these aren't intended to mark new sections on the page.

      Instead, paragraphs are typically used for large passages of text.


- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Add a new paragraph to this page by using the `p` tag.

      [snippet paragraph_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      In each of the examples we've done so far all of the text has been on one line. However, HTML allows you to put text on multiple lines.

- slide:
    content: |
      You'll notice that even though the text is on multiple lines, the [define codelab_html_preview] displays all of the text on a single line.

      In HTML, new lines are displayed as a single space between characters.

- slide:
    content: |
      This creates a problem were trying to add a new line to our webpage. However, like with most things in HTML, we can use an [define html_element] to solve this problem.

- slide:
    title: Using Line Breaks
    mode: overlay
    content: |
      The `br` tag is used to create line breaks, meaning that a new line is displayed wherever the [define html_element] is placed in the code.

      [snippet linebreak]

- slide:
    content: |
      You probably noticed that this [define html_element] looks different than the other tags you've written so far.

      [snippet linebreak highlight:4,2]

      Unlike the other HTML elements you've added, this [define html_element element] does not have a separate closing tag.

- slide:
    content: |
      This is called a [define void_element], meaning that it does not have any content.

      You'll also hear these referred to as _self-closing_ tag or _empty tags_.

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      There are many other [define html_element s] that are also [define void_element s]. You'll learn more about these and later lessons.

- slide:
    content: |
      Let's go back and add a `br` [define html_element element] between the two lines in the previous example.

      Great work! let's review what we've learned in this lesson!

- question:
    title: New lines in [define html] are displayed...

    explain: |
      Adding a new line to a webpage will display as a single space. Also, interestingly, multiple spaces in HTML are also displayed has a single space.

    choices:
      - ... as a space
      - ... as a tab
      - ... as a normal new line
      - ... as a semi-colon

- question:
    title: The `br` [define html_element Element] is known as a...
    content: |
      [snippet linebreak]

    explain: |
      A `br` [define html_element Element] is known as a [define void_element], meaning it does not have content. A [define void_element] also does not have a separate closing tag.

    choices:
      - Void Element
      - Zero Element
      - Terminator Element
      - Bytecode Element

- question:
    title: Using the `h1` [define html_element Element] is a great way to make large and bold text

    explain: |
      By default, the heading elements are displayed using bold letters. However, there are much better ways to apply visual styles to your web page.

    choices:
      - "False"
      - "True"

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      As you can see, HTML has multiple [define html_element Elements] you can use to add content to your webpages.

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Experimenting with code is a great way to learn more about how it works. You're encouraged to continue making changes to these files before moving on.

      Great work, and I'll see you in the next lesson!
