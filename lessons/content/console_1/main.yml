    title: Introduction to Programming
    content: |
      Welcome to your first lesson on basic computer programming!

      As you work through this lesson you will be asked to complete certain tasks before you can move onto the next step.

- slide:
    content: |
      Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions. These instructions are typically known as _"code"_.

      [image code-intro.jpg frame]

      You'll also sometimes hear people refer to the task of programming as _"coding"_. For the most part the two activities are one in the same.

- slide:
    content: |
      When you write code, you're writing instructions that tell a computer what it's supposed to do. A computer isn't able to think on its own, so you have to be very specific.
      
      Code in itself is a series of **[define code_condition conditions]** and **[define code_action actions]** that solve a problem.

- slide:
    content: |
      A **[define code_condition]** checks information and decides what a computer program should do next.

      For example, a program that makes sure a username and password is correct is checking for a **[define code_condition]**. The result of that condition can lead to different actions depending on _if the password is correct or not_.


- slide:
    content: |
      An **[define code_action]** is the work that a computer program does. As with the previous example, if the user's password was incorrect, the **[define code_action action]** would be to show an error message.

      If the user's password was correct, then the **action** would be to allow them access to the system.

- slide:
    content:
      Let's look at a simple example written in a "human readable" format.

- slide:
    content: |
      [snippet conditions_simple]

      You can probably figure out what these instructions are trying to accomplish by just reading through the steps in the order they are shown.

- slide:
    content: |
      [snippet conditions_code]

      Programming is very similar, but instead of using natural language, you use a programming language with special rules.

- slide:
    content: |
      In this example, the **[define code_condition condition]** that is being checked is if the `birthday` is the same as `today`. The result of this condition decides which of the **[define code_action actions]** should be performed.

      [snippet conditions_code highlight:4,18]

- slide:
    content: |
      If the **condition** is _true_, meaning `birthday` is the same as `today`, then the program would perform the first of the two **actions** and say the message "Happy birthday!".
      
      [snippet conditions_code highlight:27,23]

- slide:
    content: |
      If `birthday` did not match `today`, the **[define code_condition condition]** would be _false_ and the program would use the alternate **action** and say the message "Good morning!" instead.

      [snippet conditions_code highlight:61,21]

      In this series we're going to be learning how to use [define javascript].

      [define javascript] is a popular programming language that's used in a very large variety of applications, games, websites, and more.

- slide:
    content: |
      [define javascript] has rules about the spelling, grammar, and symbols used when writing code.

      This is also known as the [define syntax], or basically the arrangement of words and symbols to create code that can be understood by the computer.

      [snippet conditions_code highlight:3,1|13,3|22,1|24,1|30,2|47,3|51,1|58,1|64,2|79,3|83,1]


- slide:
    content: |
      Another notable rule in [define javascript] is [define case_sensitive Case Sensitivity]. Being [define case_sensitive case sensitive] means that if letters do not match in their uppercase or lowercase forms, then they are not considered the same.

      For example, the uppercase letter `A` is not the same as the lowercase letter `a`. 

      This is very important to remember when you write code since having the wrong case can cause big errors.

      There's a lot to learn when it comes to programming, so in this lesson we're going to focus on using the [define codelab_editor] to display some messages, and then fix a simple code error.

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Alright! Let's jump into writing some code and see what happens!

- slide:
    start: true
    controller: highlightFileBrowser
    content: |
      On the left side of the screen is the [define file_browser]. This is a list of all files in your project.

- slide:
    controller: waitForMainJs
    content: |
      Open the file named `main.js` by [define double_click double clicking] on it in the [define file_browser].

- slide:
    controller: codeEditorIntro
    content: |
      The code file you just opened is now in the [define codelab_editor] area. This is where you can make changes to code.

      At the top, you'll see there's a new tab added for the file you just opened.

- slide:
    controller: codeOutputIntro
    content: |
      On the right side of the screen you can see the [define codelab_code_output]. This will show the output for your file when you press the **Run Code** button.

- slide:
    controller: runCodeButton
    content: |
      Let's try and run this code example and see what happens.

      Press the **Run Code** button and watch the [define codelab_code_output] area.

- slide:
    content: |
      This is an example of using a programming feature called a _"function"_.

      We'll learn more about how to use _functions_ later. For now, let's use it so we can display messages.

- slide:
    controller: customLogMessage
    content: |
      Why don't you try changing the message that's displayed on the screen.

      Replace the current numbers with a different set of numbers and then press the **Run Code** button to see the results.

- slide:
    content: |
      Now, let's try it again, but this time you'll write the entire example on your own.

- slide:
    controller: freeConsoleMessage
    content: |
      Write another alert message with any number you'd like. Use the example below to help remind you the correct [define syntax l] to use

      [snippet console_message_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      Practice makes perfect! Let's write another alert message!

- slide:
    controller: repeatConsoleMessage
    content: |
      Write another alert message with any numbers you'd like, but this time put it at the top of the file so it runs first.

      If you're stuck, look at the other two `alert` examples for guidance.

- slide:
    mode: overlay
    content: |
      So far we've shown several alert messages that display numbers. Let's try something a little different and display a message that uses words instead.

- slide:
    content: |
      This time, instead of using a [define javascript_number], we're going to use some text. In [define javascript] this is known as a [define javascript_string].

      [snippet string_example]

      A [define javascript_string] is a series of characters. [define javascript_string s] are useful when you're working with data that uses letters and numbers, such as names, descriptions, or other blocks of text.

- slide:
    content: |
      You'll notice that the [define javascript_string] example below is written a little differently than the [define javascript_number p] we were using in the examples before.

      [snippet string_example highlight:0,1|18,1]

      The example above has [define javascript_single_quote s] that surround all of the letters. This is very important when you're writing strings.

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      You'll learn a lot more about [define javascript_string s] in later lessons, but for now let's create a few messages that use [define javascript_string s].

- slide:
    controller: insertStringAlert
    content: |
      Follow along with the example and write a new `alert` message, but using a [define javascript_string] instead.

      [snippet insert_string_example]

- slide:
    controller: freeStringAlert
    content: |
      Let's try that one more time, but this time enter any message you'd like!

      Follow along with the instructions or use the previous example as a guide on how to add another `alert` message.

- slide:
    content: |
      So far all of the code we've written has run without any issues, but sometimes you may type something incorrectly which could cause an error.

- slide:
    controller: insertNumberError
    content: |
      I just added some code to the top of the file that has an error in it. Press the **Run Code** button so we can see what happens when code isn't formatted correctly.

- slide:
    content: |
      In this case, we have an example of a [define syntax_error]. A Syntax Error means that the code can't be understood by the engine running it.

- slide:
    controller: fixNumberError
    content: |
      Try and fix this code error and then press **Run Code** when you're finished.

- slide:
    controller: insertStringError
    content: |
      Let's try this one more time, but this time we're going to use a [define javascript_string]. I've just added a new error to the top of the file.

- slide:
    controller: fixStringError
    content: |
      Try and fix this code error and then press **Run Code** when you're finished.

      I'm not going to show any hints right away, but if you get stuck I'll jump in and help you.
