    title: Introduction to Programming

      Welcome to your first lesson on basic computer programming!

      As you work through this lesson you will be asked to complete certain tasks before you can move onto the next step.

      Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

      We've talked a lot about how computer programming works, so let's jump into writing some code and see what happens.

- slide:
    controller: highlightFileBrowser
    content: |
      On the left side of the screen is the [define file_browser]. This is a list of all files in your project.

- slide:
    flags: +OPEN_FILE
    controller: waitForMainJs
    content: |
      Open the file named `main.js` by [define double_click double clicking] on it in the [define file_browser].

- slide:
    controller: codeEditorIntro
    content: |
      The code file you just opened is now in the [define codelab_editor] area. This is where you can make changes to code.

      At the top, you'll see there's a new tab added for the file you just opened.

- slide:
    controller: codeOutputIntro
    content: |
      On the right side of the screen you can see the [define codelab_code_output]. This will show the output for your file when you press the **Run Code** button.

- slide:
    start: true
    controller: runCodeButton
    content: |
      Let's try and run this code example and see what happens.

      Press the **Run Code** button and watch the [define codelab_code_output] area.

- slide:
    content: |
      This is an example of using a programming feature called a _"function"_.

      We'll learn more about how to use _functions_ in later lessons, but for now let's use it so we can display messages in the [define codelab_code_output output] area.

- slide:
    controller: customLogMessage
    content: |
      Why don't you try changing the message that's displayed on the screen.

      Replace the phrase `"hello, world!"` with something different and then press the **Run Code** button to see the results.
