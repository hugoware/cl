    title: Introduction to Programming

      Welcome to your first lesson on basic computer programming!

      As you work through this lesson you will be asked to complete certain tasks before you can move onto the next step.

      Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

      We've talked a lot about how computer programming works, so let's jump into writing some code and see what happens.

- slide:
    controller: highlightFileBrowser
    content: |
      On the left side of the screen is the [define file_browser]. This is a list of all files in your project.

- slide:
    controller: waitForMainJs
    content: |
      Open the file named `main.js` by [define double_click double clicking] on it in the [define file_browser].

- slide:
    controller: codeEditorIntro
    content: |
      The code file you just opened is now in the [define codelab_editor] area. This is where you can make changes to code.

      At the top, you'll see there's a new tab added for the file you just opened.

- slide:
    controller: codeOutputIntro
    content: |
      On the right side of the screen you can see the [define codelab_code_output]. This will show the output for your file when you press the **Run Code** button.

- slide:
    controller: runCodeButton
    content: |
      Let's try and run this code example and see what happens.

      Press the **Run Code** button and watch the [define codelab_code_output] area.

- slide:
    content: |
      This is an example of using a programming feature called a _"function"_.

      We'll learn more about how to use _functions_ in later lessons. For now, let's use it so we can display messages.

- slide:
    controller: customLogMessage
    content: |
      Why don't you try changing the message that's displayed on the screen.

      Replace the phrase `hello, world!` with something different and then press the **Run Code** button to see the results.

- slide:
    content: |
      Now, let's try it again, but this time you'll write the entire example on your own.

- slide:
    controller: freeConsoleMessage
    content: |
      Follow along with the guide to display another message in the [define codelab_code_output output] area.

      [snippet console_message_example]

- slide:
    start: true
    flags: +OPEN_FILE
    content: |
      Practice makes perfect! Let's write another alert message!

- slide:
    controller: repeatConsoleMessage
    content: |
      Write another alert message with any message you'd like, but this time put it at the top of the file so it runs first.
