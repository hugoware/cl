#       This lesson is a _"Project Lesson"_ meaning that you will be given a list of **Objectives** to complete.

#       As you work, the **Objective** list will update to show what items have been finished and which ones are still left to be done.

#       When you have completed all items on the **Objectives** list, you will have successfully finished this project!

#       The purpose of this project is to ensure that you have mastered all of the skills taught in previous lessons. There will **not** be any assistance or hints provided as you work.

#       **Please keep in mind that it's entirely possible that you might get stuck!**

#       If you find that you can't figure out how to finish this project, go back and retry previous lessons until you're ready to try again.

#       Learning something new takes practice and sometimes that means going over a topic a few times before you completely understand it!

#       There are many objectives that you will need to complete. Some objectives are not visible unless you scroll the list down to see them.

#       Additionally, as you finish groups of objectives, they will be automatically collapsed into single items on the list.

# - slide:

#       Finally, some objectives have an icon at the far right side. Moving the cursor over this icon will show the related skill.

#       If you're stuck this will help identify which lessons you should go back and review.
