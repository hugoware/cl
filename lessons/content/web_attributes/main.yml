    title: Using HTML Elements
    content: |
      In this lesson we're going look at how to use [define html_attribute]s. [define html_attribute]s are a way to provide additional information about the behavior of an HTML element.

- slide:
    content: |
      To help explain the concept of an [define html_attribute], let's walk through a simple scenario. 

      Let's say we wanted to add an image to our webpage. The correct HTML element to use in this case is the `img` element.

      [snippet image_no_attr]

- slide:
    content: |
      But what's interesting about the `img` [define html_element Element] is that it's a [define void_element], meaning it can't have any content.

      Not only that, all of the [define html_element s] we have written so far only support text. In this case we want to display an image file.

      [snippet image_no_attr]

- slide:
    content: |
      This is where we can use an [define html_attribute] to provide additional information so our `img` Element knows what to do.

      [snippet html_attribute]

      Let's walk through each of the parts that make up an [define html_attribute].

- slide:
    content: |
      To start, and a [define html_attribute] needs a name. This name will change depending on the purpose, much like the name of an HTML element changes the behavior in the browser.

      [snippet html_attribute highlight:5,3]

      In this case, the `img` Element uses the `src` attribute as the location for where the image is found.


- slide:
    content: |
      The next character that is shown is an `||=|equal sign||`.

      [snippet html_attribute highlight:8,1]

      A good way to remember this is that the name is equal to the value, which comes at the end of the [define html_attribute].

- slide:
    content: |
      The value of the [define html_attribute] is placed between two _double quotes_, one at the beginning of the value and the other at the end. 

      [snippet html_attribute highlight:9,1|18,1]

      You're also allowed to use _single quotes_, however an HTML most developers only use _double quotes_.

- slide:
    content: |
      Everything between the two _double quotes_ is the value. In this case, the **value** is telling the Image element where it can find the image file.

      [snippet html_attribute highlight:9,1|18,1]

      _We haven't discussed how paths work in HTML just yet, but we'll be discussing them in the next lesson._

      Lets give this a try so you can See it in action.

- slide:
    content: |
      Open the `index.html` file in the [define file_browser]

- slide:
    content: |
      Follow along with the instructions to add an image to this page. Use the `src` [define html_attribute attribute] to tell the `img` [define html_element element] where to find the image file to display.

- slide:
    content: |
      Let's try that again, but this time add the other two images in the project to the page. This should include `/cat.png` and `/fish.png`

- slide:
    content: |
      Great! You can see that an [define html_attribute] allows us to provide additional instructions for [define html_element elements] to change its behavior.

- slide:

      Let's look at another [define html_attribute] that's frequently used when creating web pages.

- slide:
    content: |
      This is the `a` [define html_element Element], which is used for creating [define hyperlink s]. You've seen [define hyperlink s] on most websites since you click on them to navigate between pages.

      [snippet anchor_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      You can see that this [define html_attribute] is written exactly the same as the previous example.

      [snippet anchor_example highlight:3,24]

      There is a name, an `=`, a pair of double quotes, and a value. In this case, the value is the address of the webpage to navigate to.

- slide:
    content: |
      However, unlike the `img` [define html_element Element], we are able to set the content of this [define html_element Element] using text.

      [snippet anchor_example highlight:31,16]

      When you're writing a [define hyperlink] for a webpage, this text is typically used to describe where the link will navigate the visitor to.

      Let's give it a try! Follow along with instructions to add a link to the other page in this project.

      [snippet other_page]

- slide:
    content: |
      Looks like that worked! Click on the [define hyperlink] on this page to return back to the `index.html` page.

      Great work! Let's review what we've learned in this lesson.

- question:
    title: What is the name the the `highlighted` section of code?

    content: |
      [snippet anchor_example highlight:3,20]

    explain: |
      And [define html_attribute] is an additional instruction that can be added to an [define html_element] to change its behavior. An [define html_attribute] is placed within and [define html_element Elements] opening tag.

    choices:
      - HTML Attribute
      - HTML Navigator
      - Void Element
      - Natural Delimiter

- question:
    title: What is the preferred type of quote to use with [define html_attribute]?

    explain: |
      In HTML you can use both _single quotes_ and _double quotes_ for [define html_attribute], but double quotes are preferred.

    choices:
      - Double quotes `"`
      - Single quotes `'`

- question:
    title: What is the highlighted part of this [define html_attribute]?

    content: |
      [snippet anchor_example highlight:3,4]

    explain: |
      An [define html_attribute] always starts with its name. The **name** decides the behavior of the [define html_attribute].

    choices:
      - Name
      - Terminator
      - Encoder
      - Byte

- question:
    title: What is the highlighted part of this [define html_attribute]?

    content: |
      [snippet anchor_example highlight:9,13]

    explain: |
      The characters between the _double quotes_ are the value of the [define html_attribute]. The **value** of an [define html_attribute] can greatly change the behavior of an [define html_element].

    choices:
      - Value
      - Proxy
      - Extender
      - Namespace

      Experimenting with code is a great way to learn more about how it works. You're encouraged to continue making changes to these files before moving on.

      Great work, and I'll see you in the next lesson!
