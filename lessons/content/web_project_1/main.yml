      This lesson is a _"Project Lesson"_ meaning that you will be given a list of **Objectives** to complete.

      As you work, the **Objective** list will update to show what items have been finished and which ones are still left to be done.

      When you have completed all items on the **Objectives** list, you will have successfully finished this project!

      The purpose of this lesson is to ensure that you have mastered all of the skills taught in previous lessons.

      **Keep in mind that it's entirely possible that you might get stuck!**
      
      If that happens, go back and retry previous lessons until you're ready to try this project again. Sometimes it takes going over a topic a few times before you fully understand it!

      There are many objectives that you will need to complete. Some objectives are not visible unless you scroll the list down to see them.

      Additionally, as you finish groups of objectives, they will be automatically collapsed into single items on the list.
