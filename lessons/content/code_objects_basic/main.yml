    title: Working With Objects
    content: |
      Objects are a very important part of JavaScript

- slide:
    content: |
      an example -- a car

- slide:
    content: |
      car has a color, a model, number of doors, license plate

      car:
        color           : red
        number of doors : 4
        license plate   : C0DE-LA8

- slide:
    content: |
      keep all of that information together would be useful

      this is where objects are useful

- slide:
    content: |
      here is what an object would look like

      const car = { 
        color: 'red',
        numberOfDoors: 4,
        licensePlate: 'C0DE-LA8'
      };

      the variable and object called `car` - each piece of data is a property

- slide:
    content: |
      you've actually been working with objects already by using things like `console.log`

      `console` is an object and `log` is a property on it that happens to be a function that does work

- slide:
    content: |
      we will learn more about that later for now let's look at how we can work with an object

- slide:
    content: |
      you can also access properties by using the "dot notation" that you've used in previous lessons

      alert(car.color);

      this example would pop up a message that says "red"

- slide:
    content: |
      you can edit and add new properties to an object by just assigning to is

      car.fuel = 'full';    // adds a new value

      car.color = 'blue';  // replaces a value

      alert(car.color);

      Now when the `alert` function is called, the value `blue` is printed instead of `red`

- slide:
    content: |
      objects are useful for keeping track of information that should be moved around together especially when that information is complicated

      const student = {
        firstName: 'Susan',
        lastName: 'Smith',
        age: 14,
        school: 'Coppell Middle School',
        grade: '7th',
        scores: [ 90, 95, 100, 97, 92 ]
      };
