    title: Working With Objects
    content: |
      Objects are a very important part of JavaScript

- slide:
    content: |
      JavaScript has many types of data such as strings, numbers, booleans.

      These are primitive types, meaning they're simple

- slide:
    content: |
      Objects are used to start expressing more complex things

- slide:
    content: |
      For example, think about a person

      they have a first name, last name, age

- slide:
    content: |
      All of this information is associated with one person and should be kept together

- slide:
    content: |
      JavaScript allows you to create objects that track that

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      You can probably understand what's happening in this example, but let's take a look at it

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      Like any other variable, must be declared and using the equal sign

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      An `{` and `}` are used to wrap the entire object

      [snippet person_example]

      Make sure to have a closing `}` or the code will fail

- slide:
    content: |
      Each property is represented by a name and a value

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      The name comes first

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      then a :

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      then the value - this can be strings, numbers, arrays, or even other objects

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      if you're creating something with multiple properties, each one must be separated with a ,

      [snippet person_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      each one of these
