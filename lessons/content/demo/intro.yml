      Let's make some changes to an HTML page. Let's start by opening the `index.html` page in the File Browser.

    waitFor:
      - ::fileOpen(/index.html)

    highlight:
      - ::fileBrowser(/index.html)

    validation:
      openFile: ::allowIfFile(/index.html, open-file)


- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Like with our previous example, you can see the start and ending tags

    zones:
      /index.html:
        header_start_tag: show
        header_end_tag: show

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      The words inbetween match the content on the page

    zones:
      /index.html:
        header_content: show
        header_start_tag: hide
        header_end_tag: hide

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Try and change the content to something new

    cursor: header_content

    zones:
      /index.html:
        header_content: edit

    autoNext: false
    waitFor:
      - ::event(modify-file, verifyHeaderContent)


- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Let's try that again with a different type of HTML element. This one is a paragraph

    zones:
      /index.html:
        paragraph_element: show
        header_content: hide

    cursor: paragraph_content

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      You'll notice that even though the text appears on multiple lines, it shows up as a single line in the preview

    zones:
      /index.html:
        paragraph_element: hide
        paragraph_content: show

    cursor: paragraph_content

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Try and change this paragraph to hold several more lines of text

    zones:
      /index.html:
        paragraph_content: edit

    cursor:
      zone: paragraph_content
      at: end

    autoNext: false
    waitFor:
      - ::event(modify-file, verifyParagraphContent)

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Let's try uploading an image and adding it to the page!

      Use the **Upload File** option to go to the next step

    actions:
      - deselect-items

    zones:
      /index.html:
        paragraph_content: hide

    validation:
      uploadFile: verifyFileUploadIsImage

    waitFor:
      - ::event(file-uploaded, verifyUploadImageSuccess)

    highlight:
      - ::ui(upload-file)


    flags: +upload-file-dialog

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Great! Let's add an image to the page

    zones:
      /index.html:
        img_element: expand

    flags: -upload-file-dialog

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      Type in the name of the image file - In this case, `/%uploadedFileName%`

    zones:
      /index.html:
        img_src: edit

    actions:
      - hide-all-dialogs

    flags: -upload-file-dialog

    cursor: img_src

    waitFor:
      - ::editing(verifyImageSrc)

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      You've just created a web page! It looks great
      Now that you're done, why not share it with someone!

    zones:
      /index.html:
        img_src: hide
