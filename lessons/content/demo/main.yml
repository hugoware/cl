    title: Using CodeLab
    content: |
      Welcome to the CodeLab Learning system demo!

      CodeLab uses self-paced, interactive tutorials that are a mix of explanations, coding exercises, and review questions.

- slide:

      This demo tutorial will give you a brief introduction to using [define html] to create web pages.

      **However, the primary purpose of this demo is to experience a CodeLab lesson from start to finish.**

- slide:
    content: |
      Lessons typically begin by introducing a new concept by examining code examples and highlighting relevant parts.

      [snippet base_example]

      In this case, we're looking at a code example of an [define html_element], the most basic building block when creating a webpage.

- slide:
    content: |
      [define html] code is written using [define html_element s]. Many websites have hundreds, or even thousands, of individual [define html_element Elements]

      [snippet base_example highlight:0,4|17,5]
      
      Many [define html_element Elements] are made up of a starting and ending [define html_tag tag] which are used to mark where an [define html_element] begins and ends.

- slide:
    content: |
      Anything between the starting and ending [define html_tag tags] is the content.

      [snippet base_example highlight:4,13 preview:45%]

      This particular [define html_element] would display the phrase _"Hello, World!"_ in a large and bold font.

      After learning a new concept, students are immediately given a chance to try out what they've learned.

- slide:
    content: |
      CodeLab lessons are built directly into a [define code_editor] that closely resembles what professional developers use on a regular basis.

- slide:
    controller: highlightFileBrowser
    content: |
      Files for a project are found in the [define file_browser] located on the left side of the screen.

- slide:
    waitForFile: /index.html
    content: |
      Open the file named `index.html` by [define double_click double clicking] on the file in the [define file_browser].

- slide:
    controller: highlightEditor
    content: |
      The left side of the screen is the [define code_editor]. This has many of the same features as modern code editors.

- slide:
    controller: highlightPreviewArea
    content: |
      The right side of the screen is the [define preview_area]. Students are able to see the results of the code as they work.

- slide:
    controller: addHeading
    content: |
      Let's have you try writing some HTML for yourself. Follow along with the instructions to add a heading to the page.

      [snippet base_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      Lessons will have multiple coding exercises that guide a student through writing code.

- slide:
    controller: addImage
    content: |
      Let's write some more HTML, but this time let's add an image to the page.

      This example is a little more complicated, but if you follow along with the instructions then you shouldn't have a problem!

      [snippet void_example]

- slide:
    content: |
      So far you've used [define html] to create a new heading and image. Maybe we need to use some [define css] to improve the visual appearance of the page!

- slide:
    content: |
      In later web development lessons we'll begin teaching students how to apply visual styles to their web pages using [define css].

- slide:
    controller: addStylesheet
    content: |
      Let's see what kind of difference a little bit of [define css] can make to a web page.

      Follow the instructions in include a [define css] [define css_stylesheet stylesheet].

      [snippet css_stylesheet]

    title: About CodeLab
    mode: overlay
    content: |
      CodeLab works entirely from this website, so students can write code and share creations without having to install software on their own computers.

- slide:
    content: |
      CodeLab focuses on teaching languages that are actively used by professionals today, such as [define html], [define css], and [define javascript].

      CodeLab offers courses in both basic computer programming and web development.

      Students have **access to their completed lessons from home** so they can continue to work on programming even when they aren't in class.

      Additionally, students can create their own projects and websites and then **share them with friends and family**!
