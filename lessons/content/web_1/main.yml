    title: Introduction to Creating Web Pages
    content: |
      Welcome to your first lesson on creating web pages!

      As you work through this lesson you will be asked to complete certain tasks before you can move onto the next step.

      In this tutorial we're going to start learning the basics of creating web pages.

      However, before we start learning how to write code, it's best to take a little bit of time and learn how web pages work _behind the scenes_.

-
  slide:
    controller: browserType

    content: |
      Generally speaking, web pages viewed in the browser are created using just three different core technologies. These are [define html], [define css], and [define javascript].

      [image tech.png]

      In fact, it's entirely possible that every single website you've ever visited has used all three of these technologies at the same time!

-
  slide:
    content: |
      [define html] is the foundation for all [define web_page web pages]. [define html] is a language that determines the words and content that are displayed in the web browser.

      [image html-focus.png]

      In a sense, [define html] is what your web page _says_.

-
  slide:
    content: |
      [define css] is a language that's used to determine the visual appearance of a web page. The colors, font sizes, layout, and other design properties of your web page are defined by the rules in [define css]

      [image css-focus.png]

      Simply put, [define css] decides what your web page _looks like_.

-
  slide:
    content: |
      Finally, [define javascript] is a programming language that can be used to create logic and behaviors on a web page. Many modern websites use [define javascript] to create complicated applications that run entirely in the [define web_browser browser]

      [image javascript-focus.png]

      Generally speaking, [define javascript] decides what your web page _will do_.

-
  slide:
    content: |
      Each time you visit a [define website website], code files like [define html], [define css], and [define javascript] are sent to your computer. The [define web_browser] uses the instructions in each of these files to create the [define web_page web page] you see on the screen.

      There's a lot to learn when it comes to creating web pages, but with practice and time, you'll be building entire websites before you know it.

      At the start of this tutorial series, we're going to focus on learning [define html] and then introduce [define css] and [define javascript] at a later time.

    content: Great, let's get started learning some [define html]!

- slide:
    title: What is HTML?
    content: |
      [define html] is a language that's used to describe the information found on a web page. It's written using instructions called [define html_element Elements]. An [define html_element] is made up of several parts called [define html_tag tags].

      Below is an example of a simple [define html_element].

      [snippet html_tag_example]

      Let's go over what each part of this code example ||does|duz||. 

- slide:
    content: |
      The first part of an [define html_element] is the **Opening** [define html_tag tag]. It's written using a `<` sign, followed by the name of the tag, and then a `>` sign.
      
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:0,4]

      This tells the [define web_browser] what rules to follow for everything that comes after the opening tag.

- slide:
    content: |
      The `<` and `>` signs are special characters that are used in [define html] to mark where [define html_tag tags] begin and end.
      
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:0,1|3,1]

      You'll sometimes hear these characters referred to as _"angle brackets"_ by other developers.

- slide:
    content: |
      The word between the opening and closing tags is the name of the [define html_element Element]. Each [define html_element] has a different role in the web browser.
      
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:1,2]

      For example, this `h1` Element is how you display a large heading.

- slide:
    content: |
      At the end of an [define html_element] is the closing [define html_tag tag]. It's written much like the opening tag, but there's also a `/` character after the first `<` sign.

      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:17,5]

      The closing [define html_tag] is very important because it marks where an [define html_element] stops.

- slide:
    content: |
      Everything between the opening and closing [define html_tag tags] is the content. This [define html_element Element] is a _heading_. If you were to look at this in a browser it would show up as the phrase "Hello, World!" in a large and bold font.

      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:4,13 preview:45%]

- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      We've talked a lot about how [define html] works, so let's jump into writing some code and see what happens.

- slide:
    controller: highlightFileBrowser
    content: |
      On the left side of the screen is the [define file_browser]. This is a list of all files in your project.

- slide:
    controller: waitForIndexHtml
    content: |
      Open the file named `index.html` by [define double_click double clicking] on it in the [define file_browser].

- slide:
    controller: codeEditorIntro
    content: |
      The code file you just opened is now in the [define codelab_editor] area. This is where you can make changes to code.

      At the top, you'll see there's a new tab added for the file you just opened.

- slide:
    controller: previewAreaIntro
    content: |
      On the right side of the screen you can see the [define codelab_html_preview]. This shows what the [define html] for this file looks like when viewed in a [define web_browser browser].

      This area will update automatically as you make changes.

- slide:
    content: |
      Like with the previous example, this is a heading [define html_element Element]. You can see that it uses opening and closing [define html_tag tags] to surround the content.

- slide:
    controller: changeHeadingContent
    content: |
      Let's start by changing the content of the [define html_element Element]. Replace the words "Hello, World!" with something different.

- slide:
    content: |
      Now, let's try to type in an entirely new [define html_element]. This time we're going to create both the opening and closing [define html_tag tags] as well as the content inside.

- slide:
    controller: freeHeadingInsert
    content: |
      Create the following [define html_element]

      [snippet free_heading_insert]

- slide:
    content: |
      Practice makes perfect! Let's try that again with another [define html_element].

- slide:
    controller: freeButtonInsert
    content: |
      Create the following [define html_element]

      [snippet free_button_insert]

- slide:
    mode: overlay
    content: |
      So far you've written a few simple [define html_element HTML Elements] that had some words inside.

      Each [define html_element] you created had a different effect on the contents.

- slide:
    content: |
      For example, the `h1` [define html_element Element] made the font large and bold.

      The `button` [define html_element Element] created a clickable button.

      Basically, the type of [define html_element] used will have a different effect on the contents.

- slide:
    content:
      This is where [define html] starts getting exciting!

      Text isn't the only thing that you can put inside of an [define html_element]!

- slide:
    content: |
      Many [define html_element HTML Elements] allow for you to put even more Elements inside of them.

      [snippet list_example]

      In fact, most websites you visit on the [define internet] are made up of hundreds, or even thousands, of individual [define html_element HTML Elements]!

- slide:
    content: |
      Let's review the [define html] code sample below.

      [snippet list_example highlight:0,4|48,5]

      Like with the previous examples, there are still opening and closing [define html_tag tags].

- slide:
    content: |
      Between the opening and closing [define html_tag tags] are more [define html_element HTML Elements].

      [snippet list_example highlight:6,12|20,12|34,13]

      Often times you'll hear these called [define html_child_elements] or "nested" Elements.


- slide:
    content: |
      These two [define html_element Element] types work together to create a list of numbers in the [define web_browser].

      [snippet list_example preview:45%]

      The `ol` Element tells the [define web_browser] that each of the child `li` Elements should be displayed as a new **list item**.


- slide:
    mode: popup
    content: |
      This might seem a little confusing at first, but it'll make much more sense once you try it out for yourself.

- slide:
    controller: addListItems
    content: |
      Create the list in the example below.

      [snippet list_example]

      Great work! There's still a lot to learn, but let's end this lesson by reviewing what we've covered so far.

- question:
    show: 4
    title: What is the name of the `highlighted` code?
    content: |
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:0,4]

    hint: |
      The individual parts of an [define html_element] are called tags.

    explain: |
      Each time you create a new [define html_element] you must start with an opening tag.

    choices:
      - The opening tag
      - The leading byte
      - The execute command
      - The block maker

- question:
    show: 4
    title: What is the name of the `highlighted` code?
    content: |
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:17,5]

    hint: |
      The individual parts of an [define html_element] are called tags.

    explain: |
      Each time you create a new [define html_element] you must use a closing tag to end it. You'll learn about more types in later lessons!

    choices:
      - The closing tag
      - The ending byte
      - The terminator command
      - The block breaker

- question:
    show: 4
    title: What is the name of the `highlighted` code?
    content: |
      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:4,13]

    explain: |
      The content is whatever has been added between the opening and closing [define html_tag tags] of an [define html_element]. It could be text, or even other [define html_element Elements].

    choices:
      - The content
      - The encoded matrix
      - The bytecode input
      - The binary block

- question:
    show: 4
    title: What is the name of a complete [define html] instruction? 
    content: |
      This includes the opening and closing tags as well as the content inside.

      [snippet html_tag_example highlight:0,22]

    explain: |
      Basic commands in [define html] are called [define html_element HTML Elements]. Websites use hundreds, or even thousands of them, to create the content in the [define web_browser]

    choices:
      - An HTML Element
      - An encoded terminator
      - A binary block
      - A bytecode command

- question:
    show: 4
    title: What is another name for the `<` and `>` signs in [define html]? 

    explain: |
      The `<` and `>` signs are special characters used by [define html] to identify where [define html_tag tags] begin and end.

    choices:
      - Angle brackets
      - Pointy blocks
      - Arrow bytecodes
      - Sharp codes
