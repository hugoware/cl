      Generally speaking, [define javascript] decides what your web page _will do_.


# - three main technologies
# - focusing on html
# - What is HTML

# - close tag
# - content
# - the whole thing in an element
# - let's give it a try
# - open index.html
# - change the content between tags
# - the preview area updates each time
# - try and write a new tag entirely underneath
# - shows up as a completely separate block of code
# - the name of the tag changes the behavior
# - heading tag
# - the structure is the same - name is different
# - ask them to add a heading

# - Content can also be other tags
# - Show an ordered list
# - have them add a list item
# - explain that the number 1 is not something they added
# - ask them to add 4 more items
# - emphasize each item added moves the list down
# - let's look at one more tag that
# - This can get rather complicated at times
# - some elements have even more nested elements
# - show a table
# - point out the row
# - point out the cell
# - Let's try and edit one
# - add a table with items in it
# - this one has a lot of stuff in it
# - let them add and item to the list
# - let them modify a cell
# - Great, let's add another row all together
# - Let's review what we've learned
# - Great! Let's keep going
# - What is the opening tag
# - What is the closing tag
# - what is the content
# - what is the entire thing called
