      Let's start working on code examples - open the file `main.ts`

    waitFor:
      - ::fileOpen(/main.ts)

    highlight:
      - ::fileBrowser(/main.ts)

    validation:
      openFile: ::allowIfFile(/main.ts, open-file)

#       Declare the following three variables

#       [snippet declare_variables]

    
#     persistContent: true
#     autoNext: false

#     runValidation: verifyObject
#     events:
#       - modify-file, verifyObjectSyntax

#     runValidation: verifyLog
