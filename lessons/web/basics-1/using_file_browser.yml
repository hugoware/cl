      This part has an inline *define* [define html] and this is the `>` sign -- it can do to create a website.

      [silent delay:500] show, but don't speak -- and delay

      Wait for dramatic [define html effect is amazing]

      Create a new file called `new.pug`

      If you accidentally create the wrong file type, delete and try again
