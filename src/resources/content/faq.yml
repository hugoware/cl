  question: Why does CodeLab use self-paced tutorials and not classroom lectures?
  answer: |
    There's several advantages to self-paced learning

    1. A lecture requires that all students are on the same topic, with the same understanding, at the same time. Self-paced learning allows students to focus on the topic they're studing.
    2. Professional developers do not learn in a classroom environment, but instead reading documentation and tutorials.

  question: Do you teach programming with Minecraft or Scratch?
  answer: |
    We think that games like Minecraft and block based programming languages like Scratch are a fantastic way to get kids interested coding.

    However, our goal at CodeLab is to help aspiring developers take their first steps into developing software with programming languages used by professionals.
