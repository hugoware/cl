faq:
  -
    question: What is the recommended age for CodeLab?
    answer: |
      Each student is different but we recommend that students be at least 10 years old before attending classes. **CodeLab** is intended to help young programmers to start learning the same technologies and best practices used by professional developers. 

      If you're unsure your learner is ready for **CodeLab**, let them try out the [self-paced example lesson online](/demo) to see if they're ready for the topics that we cover.

  -
    question: Why does CodeLab use self-paced tutorials?
    answer: |
      It's difficult to jump into something new, especially if you haven't had any prior experience with the topic at hand.

      At **CodeLab**, we've created self-paced tutorials that will help a new student become familiar with the basic concepts of the class so they're able to get familar with the course material without being overwhelmed.

  -
    question: Do we need to bring a laptop to attend classes?
    answer: |
      You can, if you'd like, but workstations will be available for use. If you would like to bring a your own device, it should have a keyboard, USB port, and headphone jack available.

      iPads are **not** recommended.

  -
    question: Can I see what my child is creating in class?
    answer: |
      Yes! We've discovered that being able to share work with friends and family is a great motivator for aspiring developers. Nearly every single lesson at **CodeLab** has a finished result can be shared with others when completed.

      You can also see the [Student Showcase](/showcase) to see some websites and apps created using CodeLab.

  -
    question: Do you teach programming with Minecraft or Scratch?
    answer: |
      We think that games like **Minecraft** and block based programming languages like **Scratch** are a fantastic way to get kids interested coding.

      However, our goal at **CodeLab** is to help students take their first steps into writing code with programming languages used by professional developers.

    question: Can we use CodeLab in our school district?
    answer: |
